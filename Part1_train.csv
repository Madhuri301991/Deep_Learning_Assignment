12 stones,world so cold,Rock,en,"It starts with pain, followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions no one can answer
A stain covers your heart and tears you apart
Just like a sleeping cancer
I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can be saved
How did you get here and when did it start?
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart
What kind of world do we live in?
Where love is divided by hate
Loosing control of our feelings
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
Are you sane, where's the shame?
A moment of time passes by you cannot rewind
Who's to blame and where did it start?
Is there a cure for your sickness
Have you no heart?
I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start?
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart
What kind of world do we live in?
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our soul for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold, In a world so cold
There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape
It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way
So how many times must you fall to your knees?
Never, never, never, never, never do this again
It starts with pain, followed by hate
No I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe that the world can't be saved
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our soul for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
In a world so cold"
12 stones,broken,Rock,en,"Freedom!
Alone again again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that you will call me home
The pain inside my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in you
'Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
'Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away
I question why you chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
You look at me
The tears begin to fall
And all in all faith is blind
But I fail time after time
Daily in my sin I take your life
'Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
'Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away
All the hate deep inside
Slowly covering my eyes
All these things I hide
Away from you again
All this fear holding me
My heart is cold and I believe
Nothing's gonna change
Until I'm broken
This time
Let go!
'Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
'Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away
Broken
Broken
Broken
Broken"
12 stones,3 leaf loser,Rock,en,"Biting the hand that feeds you, lying to the voice
Inside, reach out to beg for something this life
Is a lesson, take what you're given feeding on
Self destruction, waiting to explode again, no
Sign of resolution this life is a lesson, take what
You're given
You don't need direction to find your way, don't
You listen to yourself now and again killing
Time, killing you mind over matter, stop and
Listen to yourself now
Bend me before i breakdown, dying to be free
Within, it's not how you'd like to see it this life
Is a lesson, take what you're given forcing your
Self solution as you fall into line again, when
Will i find the answers this life is a lesson, take
What you're given
Falling to the ground, left face down as i recall
The mirrors ugly glare"

And I'm tired of backing down
And I'm here now feelin' the pain
Of a thousand hearts
Been to hell and back again

You can't break the broken
You still don't seem to understand
It's your turn to see just
How it feels to be me
How it feels to be knocked down
And you're here now feeling the pain

Is something for fools
Searching for hope in a hopeless time

T√¥ keep me from stumbling over my pride

I thought it would end all today

12 stones,bitter,Rock,en,"Mother mother can you hear me,I keep trying
Just to find me all I know now, all you show me,
Endless questions, hopeless ending
This bitter pill is pushing me away and now I feel
Like there's nothing left to say and I pretend to
Look the other way but in the end will I be okay,
Will I be okay
Father father will you be there as I cry out
Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,
Numb to this dream sleeping within
Before I face another day, won't you let stay asleep,
Lost among the dreams that always comfort me
And before I find my feet, won't you show me
What I need, what I need to walk again"
12 stones,it was you,Rock,en,"It was you,
That showed me who I am,
And taught me how to stand,
For what I know is real,
I was sick of all the pain,
Tired of all the shame that I felt,
But you showed me the way,
To never have a doubt,
And always to believe in myself,
Now I see,
It was you,
That showed me who I am,
And taught me how to stand,
For what I know is real,
Now I'm breathing for the first time,
And I'm leavin all this behind,
I'll become what I am because of you,
It was you,
I'm so sorry about the ways,
That I can't take away my past,
But you loved me anyway,
And now I want to do,
Everything for you that I can,
Even though it won't erase,
The foolish things that I've done,
Things that blinded me,
But now I see,
It was you,
That showed me who I am,
And taught me how to stand,
For what I know is real,
Now I'm breathing for the first time,
And I'm leavin all this behind,
And I'll stand for what I know is real,
So how can I make this up to you,
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,
Now that I'm living my life for you,
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,
Can't you see,
It was you,
That showed me who I am,
And taught me how to stand,
For what I know is real,
Now I'm breathing for the first time,
And I'm leavin all this behind,
I'll become what I am because of you,
I can see the writing on the wall,
As time begins to crawl away from me,
And I'll become what I am because of you,
It was you."
12 stones,back up,Rock,en,"
I hear the words you say to me
I see the way you look at me
I know what's on your mind so
Stand up get up back up now
Just stay away
I know the fear you hold inside
I know what's weighing on your mind
There's nothing you can do so
Stand up get up back up
You're reaching out just to be like me
But you've fallen short
Still you're following me
You had the chance to bring me down
But there's nothing left
So just stay away from me
You can't stand to see my face
To know you'll never take my place
There's nothing you can do but
Stand up get up back up now
Just stay away
I feel the hate you push on me
I see the things that you can't see
I know what's on your mind so
Stand up get up back up
It's not the things you say to me
It's not the things that I believe
You try to bring me down
So stand up get up back up now Just stay away."
12 stones,waiting for yesterday,Rock,en,"It's a long way back to reality, she puts another
Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago
Trying to figure out where things went wrong
Searching through all the lies she told
Somehow she missed out on all the things that
She needed most days spent wondering why this
Life is so cold and nothing ever changes
Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal
Yesterday
Hiding all emotion far away
Trying to find his self confidence, another
Broken heart behind the painless smile that he
Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone
And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he
Missed out on all the things he needed most days
Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and
Nothing ever changes
Tomorrow's still a miracle"
12 stones,blind,Rock,en,"I'm not okay but patiently I wait
I sit here hoping that we will be saved
Am I too late or am I just in time?
It's just too dark to see through blinded eyes
And I can't see you walk away
'Cause you're already gone
Because in this dark you are my light
The one that brings me back to life
I won't be okay doing this all alone
'Cause love is always hard to find
But without you here lately, I'm blind
I'm awake, I saw you in my dreams
You came to me and never turned away
To be okay, something's gotta change
'Cause with the lights on I still feel the same
I can't see you walk away
Tell me where did I go wrong?
Because in this dark you are my light
The one that brings me back to life
I won't be okay doing this all alone
In this life I have to choose
Between losing me and losing you
It's so unfair I do this on my own
'Cause love is always hard to find
But without you here lately, I'm blind
I stumble, you don't let me fall
Maybe you love me after all
I'll take whatever brings you back
Nobody makes me feel like that
Please don't ever let me lose your light
In this dark you are my light
The one that brings me back to life
I won't be okay doing this all alone
In this life I have to choose
Between losing me and losing you
It's so unfair I do this on my own
'Cause love is always hard to find
But without you here lately, I'm blind
Now I see through open eyes
That without you here lately I'm blind
I'm okay and patiently I wait"
12 stones,blessing,Rock,en,"Offer my hand you spit in my face
Blinded by failures you can't face the shame
The walls of your fortress come tumbling down
You cry for a savior no ones around
Paint me a picture of how things went wrong
'cause this violence play your favorite song
Swim through the void as black as your soul
Never forget
You've lost control of me
Never change who I am
Lies will never hide the truth
Pain is a blessing in disguise
I shiver at the thought of you
Now I'll see you on your way
As you fall from grace
Glued to the past a moth to a flame
Where will you hide
When you can't shift the blame
The further you fall the more that I gain
Never forget you've caused this pain
You feel
Burning deep inside of you
Behind the veil
Never take control of me
Never change who I am
Lies will never hide the truth
Pain is a blessing in disguise
I shiver at the thought of you
Now I'll see you on your way
As you fall from grace
No
You will never change
No no
You will never change
No
You will never change
No no

12 stones,the way i feel,Rock,en,"Lately I've been wandering
Off the narrow path
You've given me so many things that I've never had

And I know I need you in my life
Yes I hate the way I feel inside
And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!

The world I know is pulling me
More and more each day
I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray
Spiteful eyes are watching me
With everything I do
In the midst of darkness Lord
My spirit calls for you
‚ÄòCause I hate the way I feel tonight
And I know I need you in my life
Yes I hate the way I feel inside
And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!

You trap me, you haunt me, you trick me again
You're the reason I always give in
You have pushed me to the edge again
You lifted me up
You're tearing me down
I don't know where to go from here
Feeding the rage that hides within
You have finally locked me in
Will you ever let me go?
Pretty poison you're in my veins
Go away, go away
Won't you leave me for just one day?
Just one day?
Pretty poison you're in my veins
Go away, go away
I don't need you anymore
Leave me alone, leave me alone
All the voices inside my head
Leave me alone, leave me alone
All the voices inside my head
Pretty poison you're in my veins
Go away, go away
Won't you leave me for just one day?
Just one day?
Pretty poison you're in my veins
Go away, go away
Won't you leave me for just one day?
Just one day?
Pretty poison you're in my veins
Go away, go away
I don't need you anymore"

Nothing says rocker like a pink and black sweater
My record label called me last night
Around 10:30, yo
They told me that today I'd be shooting a video
They said there was a singer out there
Couldn't be much duller
Who wanted bad to change her image
With a little color
They said she tries to be punk rock
But wond up just a punk
With eyes that look like a racoon's
And tunes that stink like skunk
I heard that she was being sued
They saw across the line
I figured it was cause it sounds
Like ""Micky you so fine""
Then my label told me how much
I'd be making for this shoot
I hope this track can help distract
From my new white friend's lawsuit

Hey hey look look I got a real black friend
And wow she knows how to do a real back bend

And when the snow would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray
Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jetplane, far away
And break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down on your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Seeming like im having fun,

Shes is a substitute.

adam lambert,ghost town,Pop,en,"Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there's no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a damn if I go
Down down down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singin'
Oh
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
(Said, my heart)
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town"

Called out your name

In a city of rust
A city of vampires

And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there's no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a fuck if I go
Down down down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singin'
Oh
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Lorn and lonely
Torn apart

That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise

Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense
Outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

That it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart
Tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practise and phase
Out and admit
when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screamin' out down the hall
Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the wall
We're all there
Sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to your alas
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the Critical Mass
Time and space is takin' me away
Time and space is takin' me away

You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do-down on me

Between pleasure and pain

Must be one and the same
It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away

Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me

Ain't where your love should stay

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'cause you and me is two of a kind
like deja vu I feel like I've been here
or somewhere else but you've been always near
it's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for

so hard I fell out of bed

and the moral of the story, I can testify
I get stoned on you girl, that's the best reason why."

She did her best just to put on the charm
She said ""I dare you"", I said ""twist my arm""
Donnez-moi un break honey then I paid the cheque
To some psycho chick who's talkin' out the side of her neck
I...I...I tipped my hat, she winked her scandle eyes
And cracked a smile - I was mofo suprised
She's a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Yea a back seat shover
Just a dime store lover....
We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly took my breath away
Yeah when push came to shove

We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly was my cream brule'
I was ooh and ahh, she was ooh la` la`

aerosmith,"don't get mad, get even",Rock,en,"I'll tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it when you're livin' on the street
And you want to tell somebody but you got to be discreet
Then you catch your girlfriend with her skirt hiked up to here
Honey, don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Say the times they be a changin' though the blind lead the blind
You know your head is empty though there's somethin' on your mind
Been shackin' up with Lucy, and when the morning comes
You're with Sally in the alley and the junkies and the bums
You wonder why your girlfriend has her skirt hiked up to here
Honey, don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Roll the dice get lucky 'cause they roll you for the dime
You got nothin' else to lose if you only lose your mind
When pleasure that is shallow causes trouble to be deep
You've been dusted with the devil while he sweeps you off your feet
Tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it when you're livin' on the street
And you hate to be a wise guy when your feet are in concrete
Oh, sleepin' with the dogs, and you wake up with the fleas
Honey, don't get mad, get even."

You ain't got nothing on me
Some say they do
Some say they don't
I take it in stride
And I can never get enough
If I don't got to swallow my pride
I heard it all before and then
She told me ""gimme some slack""
Then she smiled at me and gave me
The shirt right off her back
And that's when I took advantage of the situation
(Chorus)
Don't stop
Rockin' your socks off
Don't stop
Knockin' their blocks off
Don't stop
Gettin' your rocks off
Don't stop
Takin' a hit, boy
Don't stop
Shakin' your fist, boy
Don't stop
I ain't got much to lose
I'm feelin' so confused
There's such a small thin line
Between pleasure and pain
And when you say don't
Then it's don't stop
I got to complain
Yeah, I think I may be getting
Real tired of all the steam
Because it's hard to get the way
You move out of my dreams
Got to get it while you can
Whenever you're in doubt
You got to whip it out
When you keep hearin' no
And your body says yes
But you can't hear a word
That's been said
But you gotta confess
Looking up her address
Got you thinkin' with your other head."

And told him what I done
He said you best go on a diet
Yeah I hope you have some fun
And a don't go burst a bubble
On rich folk who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble
When you eats that kind of food
Now they're smoking up their junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancing at the yacht club
With Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit
But go real good with wine

Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no bellyache
From eatin' humble pie

And gettin high, drank Lebanese

Chewing gum, take it to the dance tonight

Knockin' my socks off

Nobody but nobody
Shootin' never get a shot off."

That you might jive

About his old girlfriend

Since I asked her same dice dance
How the flames of my poor heart been burning
If it's hate then this must be romance

How the good time feelin' lingers
Oh, you can be alright
On the wrong side of the street
I'm so hungry for love
I've been lickin' off all my fingers

Take the bitter with the sweet

With my teeth it will taste like your grin."

I met the pony
It was so dark that i could hardly see
It smelled so sweet you know who and Joanie
So many butterflies one could not see
We all could feel desire
Took off in flight
It was hotter than fire
Than came the light
Oh, oooh
Oh, Ah, Now smell the heat
The dancing pony unwrapped his wings
To try off Joanie
The pony he grew in size
In thunder and rain
And finally realize
What he was and what he does
And what he couldn't stay
And left to kiss the cheek of Mother Nature
Nobody here can denie such things
He's created as you look'm honey
No butterfly should be denied his wings
He was a kick ass rocking horse
He like a hell bent tied to the Gavin Pole
It was a one-time fantasy
I got to grab hold and fly into the Holy Land
Bare back, riding like like a butterplane
Nightmares, and he can hold the candle to my dreams
Oh we rode tonight
I talked to believe in
What I saw all right
It was everything
We flew into burning skies
The thunder and rain
And finally realize
What he is and what he does
And what he couldn't stay
Oh, no, no...
Took off in flight
Oh, no, no...
Bare back somethings coming over me
Not mess and he can hold the candle to my dreams
No live to breathe
No stable lights
No try to please
Nobody's eyes
We'll never see lust again
And tell me the pain
Bury it all again
We have a good time
Somebody shot him down
Now tell me, tell me, tell me never
We could really cause a course in time
Listen bissin' to your old pleasures
Bissin' listenin' be a king of spine

Somehow know now truths I must be sure

Dreams of swords in hand
Sailin' ships the Viking spits
The blood of father's land

Raising swords for maidens fair

Stunk from things that used to live there
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence
With not a scrap left on the plate
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable
Cause the only thing left was their faith
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do
About it....
There's a Meltdown in the sky
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why
There's a fear that gets me high
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold
Made me wonder just who was the foe
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus
Had predicted such a long long time ago?
You could hear screams and moanin'
From the people atoning
For their sins of a guilt ridden life
And the final door shuts
From the wind that leaves cuts
From the edge on the blade of God's knife
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....

By her side, till the dawn
Couldn't kill her if they tried

In certain situations
I'm feelin¬¥ like I hung the moon
And then at times
I'm so weak from lovin¬¥
I couldn¬¥t even carry a tune
But now I'm back
Oh yes I am
I maybe fall apart at the seams
I had a nightmare
Believe me when I tell you
Nobody ever dies in their dreams
I think I need a stay of execution
In a wink, I'm dead in love again

Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain¬¥t over

Engine room to bombardier
Is the dream
I died and went to Heaven
She¬¥s enough to make you
Cry in your beer
How can a good thing
7 come 11
Slip a fare-thee-well
And how can one man¬¥s
Little bit o¬¥ Heaven
Turn into another man¬¥s Hell

aerosmith,no more no more,Rock,en,"Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddy's baby grand
I aint' seen the daylight

Fallin' appart at the seams
Tea leaf readin' gypsies
Fortune tellin' my dreams

You love it and you hate it
But to me they're all the same

Stalemate jailbate
Ladies can't refuse
You love 'em then you leave 'em
With your sold out reviews

No More, No More
Sweet talkin' barroom, ladies disease
Slippin' with her lips
Slidin' down your knees
No More, No More
No More, No Me and my life a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the acess
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they are a-changin
Nothin' ever stands still
If I don't start a-changin
I'll be writin' my will
It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the heap

aerosmith,no surprize,Rock,en,"1971, we all heard the starter gun
New York is such a pity
But at Max's Kansas City we won
We all shot shit in the bar
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
He's surely gonna make us a star
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are
But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is goin' on trial
and It was no surprise
The boys kept kickin' ass
As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Threw water on the fires of hell
She loved to shove and tell
Lord, she loved to tell
But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
And it was no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise
Midnight lady
Situation fetal
vaccinate yo ass with yo phonograph needle
I say look it here
A friend of mine
Scratch like you need calomine
Flamingo boots, soles a creakin'
Still in love and Puerto Rican too
Ridin' on the wheels of hell
Smokin' in our axle grease
The backstage is rockin'
And we're copping from the local polica
That's right, the local police
Or the juctice of peace
But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
Baby, it's no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise
Rock n' roll, junkie whore
Got my foot inside the door
Knock knock, knock knock, knock
Nobody's keepin' score
Bad time go away
Come again some other day
Topaz and sazzafraz
Will keep the blues away
Candy store, rock n' roll
Corporation jelly roll
Play the singles, it ain't me
It's programmed with insanity
You Ascap, if BMI
Could ever make a mountain fly
If Japanese can boil teas."

aerosmith,oasis in the night,Rock,en,"These days there slipping away like thieves in the night
I try to hold on to them with all my might
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last
Another tasteless coffee
Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads
What was it that they said
When we're apart the days are dark
When I'm with you I'm in the light
You're my oasis in the night..
yeah
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night
You keep our love light shinning bright
You're my oasis in the night..
yeah
When you're in my arms
you keep the world at bay
You stop it at the door
I don't care what they say
Time's too short
The fire's too hot
Don't know what to do
'cause I know in a flash
It's just a memory too
Another tasteless coffee
Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads
What was it that they said
When we're apart my days are dark
When I'm with you I'm in the light
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night
I think I'll die

I won't make the same mistake twice
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many
The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough
Love went trough such sudden change
Taken a turn for the worst
The joy turned to fear
The pain got so severe
Lord, I thought I was cursed
Get what you give
It comes around full circle

Sleepy was she
Love for the devil
Brought her to me
Seeds of a thousand
Drawn to her sin
Seasons of whither
Holdin me in
Oh woe is me
I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me
I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sails
Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken
Far far away
Heat of my candle
Show me the way
Seeds of a thousand
Drawn to her sin

then life ain't worth a dime
when they take away everything you've got
and they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight
When they work your fingers to the bone
now what does get you - nothing
in a crowd of people
you're still alone
you hope that tells you something
the road to heaven is paved in hell
and it makes you wonder
Why we're here at all
Check out the shape of the circumstance
he wears the dress and she wears the pants
here comes Jill and she needs romance
but you can't do jack so shut up and dance!
Sex is like a gun
you aim, you shoot, you run

aerosmith,sing for the moment,Rock,en,"[Eminem]
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about, his fuckin dad walkin out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap
His step-father hit him so he, socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
C'mon! Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!)
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...
[Eminem]
Entertainment is changin, intertwinin with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unnholy, only have one homie
Only this gun - lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrate; or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin to me religiously
So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B!
It's all political, if my music is literal
and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera - that was a FIST that hit you!
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
C'mon! Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing with me)
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...
[Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin to you - but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spiritslive on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...
[Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]
Sing with me (Sing!)
Sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!)

You got to walk my way
That's how it's planned
That's when I thought ""good grief""
J-just ain't my belief
Until I saw the holes
Inside his hand

Come on, come on, what you think about life?
Demon in heaven gotta carry a knife
You said to me, ""no, that ain't the plan""
With a smile on his face and the holes in his hand
Wise man tell ya what they're reading from a scroll
But things kinda change when the story gets told
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Just to sing it in the church what they're preaching in the street
Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to vacate you'll find

Good god almighty, s'posed to be about love
You must've wished upon me by kissing the glove
I'm a high-stepping lover, sharp as a knife
I'm a pink flamingo on a great long life?
A wise man, poor man, beggar man too
You bet your bottom dollar but whatcha gonna do?
I can make up daylight jealous of the night
I try to play the game but I never get it right!
Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to vacate you'll find
When you wonder what's up
With your half empty cup
Say tell him ""don't give up,
Reach for the stars""
You think you're so street wise
Just pray and close your eyes
Until we colonize
The moon and stars
But wouldn't it be great
If we could wipe the slate
When we all live in hate
And all this fear
So please don't call me ""sir""
If you're whole life's a blur
And mr
bartender
Another beer
Sometimes it's hard trying to keep up the pace
The train kept a rollin' when you're trying to win the race
If you don't believe me, wanna stay in the game
You gotta know who from the heavens came
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Cause they're singing in the church
what they're preaching in the street
If you wanna give em hell then you tell it from the steeple
But I'd rather be a priest so I can scream it to the people
Placate and vacate your miiiiind
Too late to vacate you'll fiiiiiind
You won't get too many tries
Love is the love of my life

When you feel broken and battered
When every step on the ladder
Takes you nowhere but down

I was as lonely as can be she had a beautiful *
She was lonely
She showed me her tattoo it was right there On her breast
Somewhere in a city in the middle of the West
When she asked me to her house
Little did I know she was only
She was just 18 still livin' with her folks
She was only
And when I met her momma she undressed me With her eyes
Then her daddy gave a look at me
That could have paralyzed
'Cause your mamma wants to do me and your
Daddy wants to do me in
I'm a cat with nine lives I hope that I
Can make it to ten
O'cherry please forgive me for confessin'
My original sin
Because your mamma wants to do me
And your daddy wants to do me in!

Down the stairs, I had this deja voodoo

Then it all came back to me that night back in 1973."

Still today I have so much to burn.
Yesterday I longed to die, fell to the ground, and the ground caught me.
Now today I question why I fell.
Deities fell to decoys, tainting what‚Äôs pure.
Let‚Äôs cleanse them all.
Infinite life reclaimed, as the shadows kill they are overshadowed.
We‚Äôll burn as they fade into nothing.

To understand my, my intimate is no one
When the director sold the show, who bought its last rites?
They cut the cast, the music, and the lights
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
Twenty-six years end, still speaking in these tongues
Such revelations while understood by no one
When the new actor stole the show, who questioned his grace?
Please clear the house of ill-aquired taste
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something real
I lay strewn across the floor, can't solve this puzzle
Everyday another small piece can't be found
I lay strewn across the floor, pieced up in sorrow
The pieces are lost, these pieces don't fit
Pieced together incomplete and empty
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?

I'm alone in the fight.
What's wrong, whose right?
I take it all to heart.
Your true colors start to show.
You call yourself a friend?
The teams are drawn,
you chose your side,
you'll get yours in the end.
You play along to the same old song
just as long as you can win,
when someone better comes along,
you're too cool to let them in.
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you.
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true.."
afi,yurf rendenmein,Pop,en,"You keep on sayin' that you want to know me
but you never show me your true self.
How can you ever expect someone else to know you
when all you're going to do is just pretend that
you're someone else?
You keep on sayin' that you want to show me
that you're really different, but your just the same.
If you're really mindless then there is no way
that I can win,
maybe you're just one of them,
or maybe it's just a game.
You lie to yourself and remain alone.
I'm not exactly sure of your motivation.
I'm not exactly sure what you're tryin' to do.
All I'm really sure is that you're not too impressive
and you're wearin' a mask
that I can't see through.
Maybe you're not looking for acceptance,
maybe you're striving for something more.
If it's status that you lust then why try to be one of us?
You're someone we'll never trust 'cause we know the score.."
alanis morissette,ironic,Rock,en,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
Isn't it ironic..
don't you think?
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought..

Mr
Play it Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
""Well, isn't this nice.""
And isn't it ironic ..
don't you think?
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take

Well life has a funny way
of sneaking up on you
when you think everything's okay
and everything's going right
And life has a funny way
of helping you out
when you think everything's gone wrong
and everything blows up in your face
A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic..
don't you think
A little too ironic.
and yeah I really do think...
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought..

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out"
alanis morissette,head over feet,Rock,en,"I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case time and again
I thought about it
You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was
(chorus)
You've already won me over in spite of me
Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service
(repeat chorus)
You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience
You're the best listener that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long
And I've never felt this healthy before
And I've never wanted something rational
And I am aware now
And I am aware now

I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in of theater?
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr
Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died

Of the mess you left when you went away

And i'm not going to fade
As soon as you close your eyes and you know it
And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it ..
well can you feel it?
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me

It feels so good (swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles

I certainly do
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
Feel free
Throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (to the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears

Wear it out (the way a three-year-old would do)
Melt it down (you're gonna have to eventually anyway)

alanis morissette,london,Rock,en,"What it feels to fall in to the pool
The hard shell bugs bite my forearm
My right index fingernail chewed to the quick
My cervix is a long one
My sprinklers go off at 6pm each day
And sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors
My pimples are goosehairs all over my legs
My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred
And how I do love London
And how I do love London
The birds make guttural sounds and protect me
My friends come to visit and love me a lot
I don't have the energy to fill this
I am like flight attendants on a 12 hour flight
And how I do love London
And how I do love London
I am intrigued by the boy with songs
sometimes they write sometimes they write not
The steam will smell of eucalyptus in the shower
The hug will feel forced upon you, inconsolable thing
And how I do love London
And how I do love London
Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still
To be loved and swallowed are single and depraved
I love speaking French to the taxi drivers
We slept and were cold on the train out of France
And how I do love London
And how I do love London."

swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?
Just make sure you don't tell on me
especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves
and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world
