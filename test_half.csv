riot,2013,bullet-for-my-valentine,Metal,"Are you ready it's time for war
We'll break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We won't stop 'til it's all destroyed
Let it out, just let it show
We'll burn it down, and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa oh, run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh!
Round two, are you feeling alive?
We'll overcome, we'll fucking survive
Smash the boundaries, breaking the law
We can't stop till it's all destroyed

drown,2011,carolina-liar,Rock,"Oh oh a oh x8
So soon you will learn to forget
Bad times, the rules and regrets
One day they won't reach out for you
So you put out the fires you set
As smoke fades from your last cigarette
You're a mess but yes you're beautiful
Oh come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now we can't drown in this water

Who really cares about fatal mistakes

In the long run you've got nothing to prove
So go, run while you can still get away
Take a breath while its still yours to take

I don't know why it is, but there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talkin'
Don't know why it is, but it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere

She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel and I find the strength to keep on goin'

keep-it,2006,dexys-midnight-runners,Pop,"The world lives in your front room
Youre sitting happy in gloom
Fate worries you, you will not give her room.
You give credit for might, inspiration and sight.
But you miss the point.
You wont join the fight,
You think to use is to lose so your clinging, pulling pleading.
Try and keep it safe.
Keep it cosy but it feels so out of place
Youre feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it.
It never was really proved, never was understood.
But there really is no virtue in the good.
The shoutings so loud that theyd do better to mime
Youre deafened and you cannot hear the rhyme.
But secrets in whispers pull you, try to tempt you.
Try and keep it safe
Keep it cosy but it feels so out of place
Youre feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it.
You beg for help and advice, how to handle your life.
But you dare not move, you cannot pay the price.
Chances slip, you just chatter, flatter, to forget what matters.
Spout your lines, read all your books,
You hear the sounds, miss all the hooks,
Your best is what you least understand,
You hate the graft, wont join the race,
Youre scared to scar your pretty face
Safe now cos your head is in the sand
Keep it...",6646
how-long-has-it-been,2007,freddie-hart,Rock,"Saw you there on the barstool as I walked in
And the look we gave each other said we both need a friend
Is this the first time you've come here in all the nights you've been alone
Just searching for something that just wasn't at home
How long has it been when's the last time he kissed you
My you sure look lovely in that dress so tight and thin
There's a look in your eye that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been
I sat down at your table and we shared a drink or two
And all the things that first look told me now I find are really true
Someone's neglect has left an emptiness where love used to be
Then you reached out and touched my hand softly whispered to me
How long has it been when's the last time she held you
Made you feel wanted needed and loved
There's a look in your eyes that cries somebody love me

I don't wanna be lost in smoke and fog.
I don't wanna be treated like a dog,

Kick your way from this stagnant tomb

And it's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way
Yeah it was signed by the secretary Harper Valley PTA
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Well when you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did it happened just this way

diary,2007,babyface,R&B,"I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading all about me
The words she's written took me by surprise

They said that she had found
The love she waited for
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it
And when confronted with the writing there
She simply pretended not to care
I passed it off as just in keeping with
Her usual disconcerting air
And though she tried to hide
The love that she denied
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it
And as I go through my life
I will give to her, my wife
All the sweet things I can find
I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading all about me

Her meaning now was clear to see
The love she waited for
Was for someone else, not me

Afraid to take chances that can burn up your life

Times have been so strange
So many people in and out
Getting older in my age
While these freedom thoughts stay young
I can thank you for the inspiration
And the honesty you gave
And the times those feelings came to me
During tough times where I thought of giving up, so

You got a lot to learn about life, being a wife or
Even just being my girl
Is false hype so word, change you attitude
You gotta learn to show some gratitude
Yeah, I'm on your trip but girl don't flip
'Cause I'm hip to the way you trip so just skip
All the fun and games, I know you're a faker
Yo tell 'em what she is....a money taker!
[Chorus]
Yo, the be is not a fool so what do you take me for
You think you're gettin' over, well take a look at the score
Yo 1,2,3, yep you're outta here, I?, letting you go
Savin' the rest of my tears, for someone who will
Treat me right like I should be, not tryin' to break my heart
Nor take my money, just like you drove me
Then you been driven, so get out of my life
And get into the hard livin'
[Chorus]",14638
yes-i-do,2006,chris-rea,Rock,"In the morning she brings music
Takes the dark clouds from my eyes
Gives me something to hang on to
When the cold wind fills the skies
And you ask me do I love her
Yes I do
You tell me she could leave me
This love could make me cry
All I know is I want it
And I feel it deep inside
So just ask me do I love her
Yes I do
Tomorrow is tomorrow
I just know about today
In this great big world
Would it be too much to see
Little joy come my way
So just ask me do I love her
Yes I do",17335
