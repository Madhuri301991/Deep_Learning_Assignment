riot,2013,bullet-for-my-valentine,Metal,"Are you ready it's time for war
We'll break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We won't stop 'til it's all destroyed
Let it out, just let it show
We'll burn it down, and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa oh, run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh!
Round two, are you feeling alive?
We'll overcome, we'll fucking survive
Smash the boundaries, breaking the law
We can't stop till it's all destroyed
Let it out, just let it show
We'll burn it down, we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep?
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa oh run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh!
It's time to tear it all
Riot
Whoa oh! Riot
Whoa here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh! Whoa oh! Riot",3301
the-other-side,2007,carnal-forge,Metal,"Broken hopes in a world of lies
It makes me blind as it penetrates my eyes
No escape from their morbid minds
Release me from this pain
Release me from this pain
Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die
In a desperate try to die
Just throw you shit into my face
There's no hope for human race
Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence
Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die
Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence
Just throw you shit into my face
There's no hope for human race
Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence
Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die
In a desperate try to die
Broken hopes in a world of lies
It makes me blind as it penetrates my eyes

Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die
Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence",26075
drown,2011,carolina-liar,Rock,"Oh oh a oh x8
So soon you will learn to forget
Bad times, the rules and regrets
One day they won't reach out for you
So you put out the fires you set
As smoke fades from your last cigarette
You're a mess but yes you're beautiful
Oh come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now we can't drown in this water
You been prayin for a remedy
Who really cares about fatal mistakes
Trailer park dreams don't carry much weight
In the long run you've got nothing to prove
So go, run while you can still get away
Take a breath while its still yours to take
You're a mess but yes you're beautiful
Oh come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now we can't drown in this water
You been prayin for a remedy
Oh oh a oh x8
So who really cares if you make a mistake
Ohhhhh come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now we can't drown in this water
You been prayin for a remedy
Come on down we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on down you know that you want it
You been prayin for a remedy",2245
completely,1998,98-degrees,Pop,"Completely into you
Discreetly, I will prove
That I can do
What you need me to, for you, for you
I gotta come clean with you, baby
Do anything to make you see
I gotta be with you tonight
The thought of it's consuming me
Your body next to mine
Let's not waste any time
Baby, just give me a chance
We could make some sweet romance tonight
Completely into you
Discreetly, I will prove
That I can do
What you need me to, for you, for you
And now that you are here with me
Every kiss with you is like a dream come true
It's ecstasy
We'll take it even further
If you say that it's okay
Now just let yourself go, we'll take it slow
And let's go all the way tonight
Completely into you

Discreetly, I will prove
(Discreetly, baby)

she-s-got-a-way,2012,american-idol,Pop,"She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
I don't know why it is, but there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talkin'
Don't know why it is, but it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down, inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel and I find the strength to keep on goin'
And she's got a light around her
And everywhere she goes, million dreams of love surround her everywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down, inspires me without a sound
She touches me, I get turned around
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way about her
I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her anyway",2203
keep-it,2006,dexys-midnight-runners,Pop,"The world lives in your front room
Youre sitting happy in gloom
Fate worries you, you will not give her room.
You give credit for might, inspiration and sight.
But you miss the point.
You wont join the fight,
You think to use is to lose so your clinging, pulling pleading.
Try and keep it safe.
Keep it cosy but it feels so out of place
Youre feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it.
It never was really proved, never was understood.
But there really is no virtue in the good.
The shoutings so loud that theyd do better to mime
Youre deafened and you cannot hear the rhyme.
But secrets in whispers pull you, try to tempt you.
Try and keep it safe
Keep it cosy but it feels so out of place
Youre feeling a loss but youre not fit to make it
You offered so much but youre frightened to take it.
You beg for help and advice, how to handle your life.
But you dare not move, you cannot pay the price.
Chances slip, you just chatter, flatter, to forget what matters.
Spout your lines, read all your books,
You hear the sounds, miss all the hooks,
Your best is what you least understand,
You hate the graft, wont join the race,
Youre scared to scar your pretty face
Safe now cos your head is in the sand
Keep it...",6646
how-long-has-it-been,2007,freddie-hart,Rock,"Saw you there on the barstool as I walked in
And the look we gave each other said we both need a friend
Is this the first time you've come here in all the nights you've been alone
Just searching for something that just wasn't at home
How long has it been when's the last time he kissed you
My you sure look lovely in that dress so tight and thin
There's a look in your eye that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been
I sat down at your table and we shared a drink or two
And all the things that first look told me now I find are really true
Someone's neglect has left an emptiness where love used to be
Then you reached out and touched my hand softly whispered to me
How long has it been when's the last time she held you
Made you feel wanted needed and loved
There's a look in your eyes that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been",16298
just-in-time-for-the-epilogue,2007,g-b-h,Rock,"Out of the frying pan, into the microwave.
I need my fill, gotta satisfy my craves.
I missed out again, 'cus I ain't had enough,
When the tough go shoppin', the shoppin' gets tough.
I don't wanna be treated like a dog,
I don't wanna be lost in smoke and fog.
I don't wanna be treated like a dog,
don't wanna be just in time for the epilogue.
Give me a break, don't give me no abuse.
If you carry on, I'm gonna blow a fuse.
Just gire me one more day.
I'll make up tme for sure.
I know I'm sick inside,
so help me find a cure.
Procrastination's stealing all my time.
What the story, will everything turn out fine ?",9039
texman,2006,beatles,Rock,"Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman
'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'cause I'm the taxman,

Declare the pennies on your eyes

push-your-head-towards-the-air,2007,editors,Rock,"If I lay face
Down on the ground
Would you walk all over me?
Have we learned
What we set out to learn?
Well then, love, we will see
[Chorus:]
Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
Push your head toward the air
Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
I will always be there
When you fall and you
Can't find your way
Push your hand up to the sky
I will run just to
To be by your side
Don't you ever bat an eye
[Chorus]
But I will tear the price from your head
And keep you from harm - that's what you said
There's people climbing out of their cars
Lining the roadside, trying to glimpse at the dead

we-live,2001,bosson,Pop,"We Live and we die
And we learn to find
The things we live and die for
I don't want to be an ordinary man
No I don't want to be as neat as a new pin
I don't care about just being safe and calm
Give it up for little li li life
Give it all up for little li li life
I don't want to be a worker everyday
No I don't want to be a boss that you obey
I don't care about what people might just say
Give it up for little li li life
Give it all up for little li li life
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking, till the end
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating
[Chorus]
I don't want to say I didn't take the chance
I don't want to say I never learned the dance
I want to be someone, someone they show respect
Give it all up for a little li li life
Give it all up for a little li li life
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking, till the end
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating
[Chorus]
Life is all to short to spend on doing boring things,
And I want and I want I want to have fun
Holding on to be the one I am
Holding on to be the one I am...

black-machine,2007,cirith-ungol,Metal,"Climb aboard the black machine
Fills your head with evil dreams
Fills your head with thoughts of fire
A quick escape - your one desire
Ride the black machine
Pearly whites behind back drawn lips
Ride with the masters of the pit
Snapping jaws of the dogs of doom
Kick your way from this stagnant tomb
Ride the black machine",26307
hey-john-whats-your-name-again,2007,the-devil-wears-prada,Metal,"The concept of fashion is the one to blame
Painting the portrait of conviction, less existence.
Well, it must be difficult being so gorgeous
Claiming to be the kings and queens but it's all of nothing
This shall pass
Megalomania
This shall pass

Congratulations on mutilation for a life
I'm going to hope for you, I'm going to pray for you amongst the wreckless and the black
I'm going to pray for you amongst the wreckless and the black
Salvation lies within.
I'm going to pray for you amongst the wreckless and the black
My time is your's my friend
We all find ourselves so horribly weak.
